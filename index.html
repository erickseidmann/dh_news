            On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are 
            so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, 
            that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs 
            to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will,
             which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.
             <br> <br>
             <ol>
                 <li>When our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents</li>
                 <li>He rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures</li>
                 <li>The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection</li>
             </ol>

             On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are 
             so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, 
             that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs
              to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through 
              shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. 
              In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able
               to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain 
            circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently 
             occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted.
